# Misty II Robot Teaching Basic Concepts Using Retico Incremental Framework

This repository provides a collection of interactive modules for the Misty II robot to teach basic concepts such as numbers, arithmetic, and colors to young learners. These modules leverage the Retico Incremental Framework to facilitate real-time communication.

## Curriculum

### 1. Teaching Numbers
This module introduces numbers and helps learners practice counting.

**Runner Files:**
- `counting_runner.py`
- `nc_runner.py`

### 2. Teaching Arithmetic (Addition and Subtraction with Objects)
This module uses objects to teach the concepts of addition and subtraction.

**Runner Files:**
- `arithmetic_runner.py`

### 3. Teaching Colors Using Objects
This module helps identify and name colors using objects.

**Runner Files:**
- `colors_runner.py`
- `cc_runner.py`
